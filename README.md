# 🖼️ Image Captioning App

A simple and interactive **Image Captioning Web Application** that uses AI to automatically describe the contents of an image in natural language.  
This project was built as part of the **IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate** program.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application takes an uploaded image as input and generates a descriptive caption using a trained AI model.  
It demonstrates how deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) can work together to interpret visual data and express it through text.
